This is a standalone release of the `x/forwarding` module introduced to Noble's codebase in the `v4.1.0` Fusion release.

The module has been ported from [noble-assets/noble@`bb9ee09`](https://github.com/noble-assets/noble/commit/bb9ee097f09ce3e923242e9bac3ac997f0d44f8b), which was the latest commit hash that [Halborn](https://www.halborn.com) audited. We have additionally upstreamed [noble-assets/noble#350](https://github.com/noble-assets/noble/pull/350), which introduces a small fix to the forwarding IBC middleware.
